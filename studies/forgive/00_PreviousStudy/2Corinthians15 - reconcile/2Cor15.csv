2Co,5,1,"For[G1063] we know[G1492] that[G3754] if[G1437] our[G2257] earthly[G1919] house[G3614] of [this] tabernacle[G4636] were dissolved,[G2647] we have[G2192] a building[G3619] of[G1537] God,[G2316] an house[G3614] not made with hands,[G886] eternal[G166] in[G1722] the heavens.[G3772]"
2Co,5,2,"For[G2532][G1063] in[G1722] this[G5129] we groan,[G4727] earnestly desiring[G1971] to be clothed upon[G1902] with our[G2257] house[G3613] which[G3588] is from[G1537] heaven:[G3772]"
2Co,5,3,"If[G1489] so[G2532] be that being clothed[G1746] we shall[G2147] not[G3756] be found[G2147] naked.[G1131]"
2Co,5,4,"For[G2532][G1063] we that are[G5607] in[G1722] [this] tabernacle[G4636] do groan,[G4727] being burdened:[G916] not[G3756] for that[G1894] we would[G2309] be unclothed,[G1562] but[G235] clothed upon,[G1902] that[G2443] mortality[G2349] might be swallowed up[G2666] of[G5259] life.[G2222]"
2Co,5,5,"Now[G1161] he that hath wrought[G2716] us[G2248] for[G1519] the selfsame thing[G846][G5124] [is] God,[G2316] who[G3588] also[G2532] hath given[G1325] unto us[G2254] the earnest[G728] of the Spirit.[G4151]"
2Co,5,6,"Therefore[G3767][G2532] [we are] always[G3842] confident,[G2292] knowing[G1492] that,[G3754] whilst we are at home[G1736] in[G1722] the body,[G4983] we are absent[G1553] from[G575] the Lord:[G2962]"
2Co,5,7,"(For[G1063] we walk[G4043] by[G1223] faith,[G4102] not[G3756] by[G1223] sight:)[G1491]"
2Co,5,8,"We are confident,[G2292] [I say], and[G1161][G2532] willing[G2106] rather[G3123] to be absent[G1553] from[G1537] the body,[G4983] and[G2532] to be present[G1736] with[G4314] the Lord.[G2962]"
2Co,5,9,"Wherefore[G1352] we labour,[G5389] that,[G2532] whether[G1535] present[G1736] or[G1535] absent,[G1553] we may be[G1511] accepted[G2101] of him.[G846]"
2Co,5,10,"For[G1063] we[G2248] must[G1163] all[G3956] appear[G5319] before[G1715] the judgment seat[G968] of Christ;[G5547] that[G2443] every one[G1538] may receive[G2865] the things [done] in[G1223] [his] body,[G4983] according[G4314] to that[G3739] he hath done,[G4238] whether[G1535] [it be] good[G18] or[G1535] bad.[G2556]"
2Co,5,11,"Knowing[G1492] therefore[G3767] the terror[G5401] of the Lord,[G2962] we persuade[G3982] men;[G444] but[G1161] we are made manifest[G5319] unto God;[G2316] and[G1161] I trust[G1679] also[G2532] are made manifest[G5319] in[G1722] your[G5216] consciences.[G4893]"
2Co,5,12,"For[G1063] we commend[G4921] not[G3756] ourselves[G1438] again[G3825] unto you,[G5213] but[G235] give[G1325] you[G5213] occasion[G874] to glory[G2745] on[G5228] our[G2257] behalf,[G5228] that[G2443] ye may have[G2192] somewhat to[G4314] [answer] them which glory[G2744] in[G1722] appearance,[G4383] and[G2532] not[G3756] in heart.[G2588]"
2Co,5,13,"For[G1063] whether[G1535] we be beside ourselves,[G1839] [it is] to God:[G2316] or whether[G1535] we be sober,[G4993] [it is] for your cause.[G5213]"
2Co,5,14,"For[G1063] the love[G26] of Christ[G5547] constraineth[G4912] us;[G2248] because we thus[G5124] judge,[G2919] that[G3754] if[G1487] one[G1520] died[G599] for[G5228] all,[G3956] then[G686] were[G599] all[G3956] dead:[G599]"
2Co,5,15,"And[G2532] [that] he died[G599] for[G5228] all,[G3956] that[G2443] they which live[G2198] should[G2198] not henceforth[G3371] live[G2198] unto themselves,[G1438] but[G235] unto him which died[G599] for[G5228] them,[G846] and[G2532] rose again.[G1453]"
2Co,5,16,"Wherefore[G5620] henceforth[G575][G3568] know[G1492] we[G2249] no man[G3762] after[G2596] the flesh:[G4561] yea,[G1161] though[G1499] we have known[G1097] Christ[G5547] after[G2596] the flesh,[G4561] yet[G235] now[G3568] henceforth[G3765] know we[G1097] [him] no more.[G3765]"
2Co,5,17,"Therefore[G5620] if any man[G1536] [be] in[G1722] Christ,[G5547] [he is] a new[G2537] creature:[G2937] old things[G744] are passed away;[G3928] behold,[G2400] all things[G3956] are become[G1096] new.[G2537]"
2Co,5,18,"And[G1161] all things[G3956] [are] of[G1537] God,[G2316] who[G3588] hath reconciled[G2644] us[G2248] to himself[G1438] by[G1223] Jesus[G2424] Christ,[G5547] and[G2532] hath given[G1325] to us[G2254] the ministry[G1248] of reconciliation;[G2643]"
2Co,5,19,"To wit,[G5613] that[G3754] God[G2316] was[G2258] in[G1722] Christ,[G5547] reconciling[G2644] the world[G2889] unto himself,[G1438] not[G3361] imputing[G3049] their[G846] trespasses[G3900] unto them;[G846] and[G2532] hath committed[G5087] unto[G1722] us[G2254] the word[G3056] of reconciliation.[G2643]"
2Co,5,20,"Now then[G3767] we are ambassadors[G4243] for[G5228] Christ,[G5547] as though[G5613] God[G2316] did beseech[G3870] [you] by[G1223] us:[G2257] we pray[G1189] [you] in[G5228] Christ's[G5547] stead,[G5228] be ye reconciled[G2644] to God.[G2316]"
2Co,5,21,"For[G1063] he hath made[G4160] him [to be] sin[G266] for[G5228] us,[G2257] who[G3588] knew[G1097] no[G3361] sin;[G266] that[G2443] we[G2249] might be made[G1096] the righteousness[G1343] of God[G2316] in[G1722] him.[G846]"
